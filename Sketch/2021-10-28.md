## Better Oh-My-Zsh

- You could have a better a iterm when you choose a good theme

``` shell
vim ~/.zshrc            # edit the config of zsh
/ZSH_THEME              # use vim search to find the key for ZSH_THEME
ZSH_THEME=THEME_NAME    # change the theme to you want
```

- You could edit the theme config to make you own zsh

``` shell
vim ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme  # edit the config of zsh-theme
vim %{$fg[cyan]%}%c%{$reset_color%} -> %{$fg[cyan]%}[$PWD]%{$reset_color%}      
                                                # robbyrussell is theme name, and more detail in github
```
